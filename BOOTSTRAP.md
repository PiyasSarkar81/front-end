# Bootstrap
* Bootstrap is often described as a way to "build fast, responsive sites" and it is a "feature-packed, powerful, and extensible frontend toolkit". 
* Some people refer to it as a "front-end" framework, and some are trying to be more specific by referring to it as a "CSS framework" or a “CSS library”. 
* Modern web development is all about components. Small pieces of reusable code that allow you to build websites quickly. Bootstrap comes with multiple components for very fast construction of multiple components, or parts of components. 
* Another important aspect of modern development is responsive grids which allow web pages to adapt their layout and content depending on the device in which they are viewed. Bootstrap comes with a pre-made set of CSS rules for building a responsive grid.
